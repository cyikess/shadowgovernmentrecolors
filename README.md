# hey what up its me nova
So, here's the thing. I can be... *particular* when it comes to theming. But sometimes, what I want may not match what the general public wants. Additionally, I also like options and accessibility, and hate social interaction. So in an effort to make everything much easier, I made this fork!
## what is this?
This is a fork of the regular Community Recolors pack, which will include some different icons than the original. In it, I'll be adding any variation on any icons we make to match our personal ideas without infringing on other people's work; starting with the removal of blue accents from Recruit icons. You'll notice most folders are empty or missing: that's on purpose! This is intended to be an addition to the original pack. All those icons are found there!
## how do i use this?
Make sure to follow the Community Recolors guide and install that into Fancy UI first. Then, download any icons from here you'd rather use and replace them in the mod folder!
## who can use this?
Anyone can! I'm doing this for me and my friends, but I seriously do not mind. In fact, Community Recolors can take of my images from this pack and add them to the original github. This is for orginization and ease of use. It's a fork, not a knife, after all.
